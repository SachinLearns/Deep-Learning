Problem Statement: 
Companies offering software services need to reach out to potential clients by sending cold emails, tailored to specific job postings. 
Crafting these emails manually takes time and effort, especially when aligning them with the required skills. 
A tool using an AI language model can automate this process by generating relevant, personalized emails based on the job listing.
